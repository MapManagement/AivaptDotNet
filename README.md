# Aivapt .NET
This project tries to replace my old Discord bot called "Aivapt". On one hand
I really had to improve my old code so that the bot would run more stable. On
the other hand I really wanted use [Discord .NET](https://docs.stillu.cc/index.html)
this time instead of [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Therefore I'm using C# and not Python anymore.
